I am cuurently an Assistant Professor at [Department of Computer Science & Engineering](http://www.eecs.psu.edu/) of [Pennsylvania State University](http://www.psu.edu/). I run the **Optimization and Machine Learning Lab**, where we work on fundemantal computational and theoretical problems in machine learning.

Before joining PSU, I was a research assistant professor at [Toyota Technological Institute](http://www.ttic.edu/), at [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. [Rong Jin](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~rongjin/) from [Michigan State University](https://www.cse.msu.edu/). I received my M.Sc in Computer Engineering department at [Sharif University of Technology](http://ce.sharif.edu/) where my advisor was Prof. [Mohammad Ghodsi](http://sharif.ir/~ghodsi/), and my BS from [Tehran Polytechnic](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/home.htm?depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en). In the past I have worked at Microsoft Reaserch and NEC Laboratories America as research intern.

### Research Interests

I am broadly interested in machine learning and design and analysis of algorithms with a focus on:

- Large Scale Machine Learning and Big Data

- Statistical and Adversarial Learning Theory

- Computational Learning Theory

- Convex, Non-convex and Combinatorial Optimization Theory
